        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            In 2023, motivated by family, friends, and a personal drive, I committed myself to a career in technology, though my journey in computer science began much earlier. Growing up in New York City, my interest in technology was sparked in a specialized middle school, where I learned basic HTML and CSS, and continued through high school with influences from my brother and a passion for gaming. This passion led me into the world of hacking, where I developed technical skills and collaborated globally with other hackers, gaining a deep understanding of programming and software development at an early age. After high school, I shifted focus to biology and fitness but returned to technology in 2023, driven by dissatisfaction with my career path. Embracing the cloud, I enrolled in AWS Cloud Institute, rapidly acquiring new skills and certifications. Now, as I prepare for my first professional role in technology, I reflect on my unique journey and aspire to excel in cloud technology, driven by a lifelong love of learning.
        </p>

        <h2>How it Began</h2>
        <p>
            In 2023, I made a choice, influenced by my family, my friends, and mostly, myself. That choice was to commit myself to whatever it took to enter, establish, and excel in my career in technology. But in actuality, my story begins much earlier than 2023, when it comes to the world of computer science and the power of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in New York City, the youngest of five children with a single mother who placed an emphasis on academia from an early age. My siblings and I were born within a seven-year span of one another which I credit for the lifelong cohesion I have with them, and helps explain how my path has always been in some way modeled after them. I attended a specialized technology-driven middle school in 2004, a small nine-year-old having a giant book bag custom made for the bulky laptops of the era. This was my first introduction to computer science, learning basic HTML and CSS which admittedly helped my personal pursuits of having the best-customized MySpace profile. This was back when Microsoft was transitioning from Windows 2000 into Windows XP which felt like a seismic shift even to my adolescent brain. It was my first experience in seeing exactly how quickly technology evolves in our modern age, something that anyone in this field can understand comes with excitement and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beginning in 2007, I attended the specialized high school Bronx Science in NYC. By this time I was already proficient with the common computer uses of the day from the Microsoft Suite of tools Word, Excel, PowerPoint, using Notepad to create HTML websites, and understanding how websites operated. At this time, my older brother was studying computer science at Stuyvesant High School and had been bringing home a bunch of textbooks to add to our already crowded library. I would often see him reading one massive textbook with the words C++ being displayed prominently on the cover. One day, in typical little brother fashion, I asked what that book was all about, this was my first introduction to a programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
            My desire to be like my older brother is what started me down the path of applied computer science concepts, but my love for computer games was what ignited a passion that would last my entire high school career. While other high schoolers were busy socializing after school, I would return home with haste to get some computer time in a house of five children and only one computer. I loved playing MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games), FPSs (First Person Shooters), and everything in between. My love for these games combined with my increasing proficiency in understanding computers as information systems sparked an idea that would lead to my first unofficial job as a software developer at the tender age of 16.

        <h2>My Start as a Hacker</h2>
        <p>
            If you’ve ever played an online computer game then you know the bane of every player's existence, people who use hacks, cheats, or any type of manipulation. It would frustrate the hair off my head whenever my online playing experience was diminished by players who made the playing field feel very imbalanced. Ironically enough, it was my need to vent about these hackers on online communities that led me to become what I hated so much at the time. I stumbled onto GamerzPlanet around 2008, a forum with sub-forums that included basically every popular game at the time. It was here that I ended up connecting with the people who were creating the hacks that I hated encountering in games. This was also when I saw that they were selling the programs they were creating for these games, a lightbulb went off in my head and the rest was history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now before going into this, I understand the unethical nature of hacking and my behavior as a teenager. I understand that being young does not absolve me of consequences, as if I were ever to get into trouble for going into the details I am about to, so be it. This is an honest expression of why I love computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding how modern software development teams operate today makes me laugh in a way, since when I look back I can say it was a very similar process to the one we developed to hack online games. The way we learned to collaborate for a common goal even while being across the world really accentuates the beauty of technology. My two favorite games at the time were MapleStory and Soldier Front, released by Nexon and IJJI respectively, so those were the games I wanted to make hacks for. I never met the people of the hack development teams physically, but they were the people I became closest to. Correspondence back then was very different so we went from communicating through email, then private messages on GamerzPlanet, to finally to instant messaging through more anonymous channels. I was connected to my development team, I understood my role on the team, and it was finally time to apply my technical skills to help create something and make some money.
        </p>

        <h2>My Life as a Hacker</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding a programming language is one thing, creating a functional program is an entirely different beast. That statement holds true even today in 2024, but programming came with so many different challenges in 2010. I can fully appreciate the maturity and sophistication of the languages and tools available to developers today because I can remember when everything was a “make it yourself” approach to anything that you needed to use and have to create functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the frontend side of development, back then we eventually arrived at using Visual Studio 2008 to create GUIs after dabbling with other methods. It's amazing to see VS has survived and evolved into what it is today. This allowed us to create GUIs for our programs to make us stand out from the rest of the hack vendors. I began my role with the team as a GUI specialist as I was still learning how to perform the other roles and backend tasks. I became adept at creating the stylistic appearance of the GUI and scripting the functionality of any component the team needed for program interactivity. During that time I started learning my second programming language, JavaScript, to better suit my frontend development role. After a couple of months of intense mentorship from my brother and the team, I was finally ready to help out with backend development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Switching from frontend to backend development felt overwhelming even for me, someone who had the aptitude and guidance of multiple mentors. Luckily my mentor’s persistent affirmations that it was something they all went through as well, try your best to keep picking things up as you go and the feeling will lessen. Our team primarily used the CheatEngine program to help us understand more about the game we were intending to hack and what exactly our program needed to be in order to function properly. Our primary strategy of attack was to locate the arrays of data we wanted to manipulate, identify all the dependencies through pointer tables on what we were about to change, and create a system to either bypass the data checks entirely or to mimic the normal operation of the expected I/O dataflow. In the infancy of these games, this process was pretty straightforward as there was little to no security in a lot of these games so peeking under the hood was a simple task. But as anyone in cybersecurity understands, an eternal arms race was about to begin, the battle between security and hackers was on. Gone were the days where the hard part was creating a program that worked however you did it, enter the days where the design of your program would determine if it could work at all. We could already see development time going up meaning that profits were about to go down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 2011 security protocols for games were becoming more sophisticated as the rampant growth and presence of hackers was threatening the allure of fair computer gameplay. Introducing GameGuard, a tool used by Nexon to protect MapleStory from hackers and the bane of our existence. The game of cat and mouse was on. We had entered an era where we would create and deploy a hack for infinite life, godmode etc. and if we did a solid job, it would take them a month or so to patch it. Their deployment of new game security concepts like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checks) forced our development process to change completely. We abandoned the model of creating monolithic programs in favor of using a decoupled DLL injection model to overcome the new security protocols featured in these programs. This came with challenges. I learned that the development process can seemingly stall when adapting to change and creating a solution through trial and error, so by no means was this a smooth transition. We experimented with using virtualization in attempts to hide our program code in the newly virtualized runtime environment as a method to bypass increasing security and hook checks which took weeks to learn, understand and successfully implement. I love and appreciate how this new challenge forced us to learn more computer science and new concepts to deal with an evolving landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            After high school had ended, I saw the “real world” approaching and shifted my focus from online games and computers to biology and the human machine.
        </p>

        <h2>Return to Technology</h2>
        <p>
            After high school, I started down the track of Biology which eventually led me into the world of health and fitness. After a journey of trying to align my personal love for health and fitness with a career track in the field, I have learned much more about myself and have accomplished many personal milestones. After mulling over my future, I thought of the past so in 2023 feeling dissatisfaction with my long term career plans, I consulted everyone I knew in the tech field on what the landscape of the industry was like today. I already developed the resolve to start a new chapter in my life by any means, now I needed to construct the path. After seeing frontend development as a great entry point as it was where I began the first time, I began relearning JavaScript in July of 2023. It was in January 2024 that a new idea formed and crystallized after spending the latter half of the last year understanding what the technology ecosystem looked like today, and wondering what it would look like in the future. I knew a more ambitious goal was to go straight into full stack development but it was something more beyond that. The career path I wanted was waiting for me in the cloud, and while many of the things I have already learned would help me, this was a mostly new undertaking I was set on.
        </p>
        <p>
            After exploring the almost limitless options on how to approach self learning for cloud operations and development, I chose AWS Cloud Institute. Simply figuring out what to start learning was already daunting enough, not even mentioning choosing the technical skills and knowledge you want for a particular role, I knew that I needed to make this part easier for myself. The only choice to make now was to pick between the 1-year, 18-months, or 3-year program pace regardless of having to invest over $10,000 into myself. My ambition did not let me choose anything other than finishing in one year. I was too late to begin the AWS Cloud Institute curriculum in January so I used that time to begin learning Python and cloud fundamentals to give myself the best chances to hit the ground running. I blazed through the first three months of the program with time to spare, which with my newfound understanding of the cloud, helped me further understand what skills I was lacking that would be needed to be ahead of the curve. I used the time between semesters to gain knowledge and experience outside of AWS, picking up Microsoft Certifications and undertaking AI/ML learning paths to widen my foundational knowledge base horizontally as I simultaneously build vertically into specialization. Quite the task but it makes much more sense when you know me and see who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also used that time to start planning out the projects I wanted to include in my portfolio as well as identify where the knowledge gaps for the completion of those projects are. This has been an excellent way to measure my progress and assess my technical capabilities and gaps as I learn and prepare for a professional role. Constantly assessing how far I was from every milestone or goal I wanted to accomplish helped spur me into maintaining a pace similar to the progression of AI this decade, breakneck speed. It was not enough to be just good enough for my first job, I wanted to be equipped with the mindset and technical skills to hit the ground running. As this challenge recedes into the past and a new challenge awaits, I am excited to take the lessons learned on this self-paced journey and use them to add value to a business team.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to acknowledge my happiness with the pace at which I have regained proficiency in this field and how my unique life journey has played into that. I have confidence in my ability to efficiently learn and competently work with any technology stack. I have strategically gained the unique set of relevant in demand skills and knowledge that the rate of change in technology inevitably creates. As I prepare to enter my first professional role in technology, I have written this to give any reader an in-depth understanding as to who I've been, who I am now and who I want to become. I intend to develop invaluable expertise in cloud technology and use my lifelong love of learning to flourish in my tech career.
